This template is for showing the user an empty form that will build a new transaction, the user object is not available
as we
don't need to display any user data for this form. This template will need to import a script that gathers the form
fields and then
submits them in a request to "/transaction/create" as a POST request.


CREATE A TRANSACTION FORM - USER OBJ AVAILABLE {{user.email}} {{user.balance}}
