{{!-- This partial will render a category object to a bootstrap card object. The data available for this template is {{category}} but check the parent template uses this alias. 
For example, the profile template may have a call in it like this:
{{#each categoryObjs as |category|}}
    {{> transaction-card}}
{{#each}}
Then the category fields can be referenced as {{name}}, {{color}} etc
There is no client side js for this partial --}}
