{{!-- This partial will render a transaction object to a bootstrap card object. The data available for this template is {{transaction}} but check the parent template uses this alias. 
For example, the profile template may have a call in it like this:
{{#each transactionObjs as |transaction|}}
    {{> transaction-card}}
{{#each}}
Then the transaction fields can be referenced as {{type}}, {{amount}} etc
There is no client side js for this partial --}}
