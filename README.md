## Description

A budgeting app using node, express, mysql and heroku  

## User Story

AS A FINANCIALLY SAVVY PERSON
I WANT TO USE A WEBSITE THAT ALLOWS ME TO VISUALISE MY FUTURE FINANCIAL POSITION
SO THAT I CAN AVOID OVERDRAWS AND LATE FEES

GIVEN A DEPLOYED BUDGETING WEBSITE THAT ACCEPTS USER INPUT
WHEN I ARRIVE FOR THE FIRST TIME
THEN I AM PRESENTED WITH A LANDING PAGE
WHERE I CAN EITHER SIGN UP OR LOG IN WITH A USERNAME AND PASSWORD

WHEN I LOG IN
THEN I AM PRESENTED WITH A PROFILE PAGE INCLUDING THE CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCE AND FUTURE TRANSACTIONS

WHEN I CLICK ON PROFILE BALANCE
THEN I AM ABLE TO CHANGE MY CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCE 

WHEN I CLICK ON UPDATE A TRANSACTION
THEN I CAN UPDATE THE TRANSACTION NAME, STARTING DATE, FREQUENCY,  AMOUNT AND DAYS LEFT

WHEN I CLICK DELETE A TRANSACTION
THEN I AM PRESENTED WITH A CONFIRMATION THAT I WANT TO DELETE THAT TRANSACTION 

WHEN I CLICK TIMELINE
THEN I AM PRESENTED WITH A GRAPH
THAT DEPICTS MY CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCE AS INFLUENCED BY FUTURE CREDIT AND DEBIT TRANSACTIONS
